# UK121

UK121 is an adaptation of [TerraPlusPlus](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth/terraplusplus) for Minecraft Fabric 1.17.1  
Developed by George112n and ELgamer  

The aim of this project is to update BTE UK to version 1.17.1 of Minecraft, this requires a mod that can generate the terrain of the world in Minecraft 
without relying on the height extending mod [CubicChunks](https://github.com/OpenCubicChunks/CubicChunks).
This is possible by extending the Minecraft build limit above the default values.   

**This mod is under development with no planned release date!**
